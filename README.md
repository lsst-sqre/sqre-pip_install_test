# pip-install-test
A stub package for testing if pip install is working.

## Introduction
The intent of this package is to provide a simple module that can be easily installed and uninstalled.
This provides a straightforward mechanism for showing that an arbitrary environment is capable of installing third party modules via `pip`.
It is not intended to exercise the full feature set of `pip` or `setuptools`, but to provide a minimal existence proof of viability.

## Usage
Install:  
```pip install pip-install-test```  
or  
```pip install --user pip-install-test```

Import:  
```>>> import pip_install_test```  
or  
```python -c 'import pip_install_test'```

Unisnstall:  
```pip uninstall pip-install-test```
